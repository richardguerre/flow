# Keyboard shortcuts

- Looked at using [react-shortcuts](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-shortcuts) but it's written in JS and doesn't have TypeScript types (no @types/react-shortcuts).
- Looked into react-hotkeys and react-hotkeys-hook, which are better, but still not what I want.
- I could use react-hotkeys-hook and use the `useHotkeys` hook globally, and have a separate react context that keeps track of which element is in focus, then combining the 2.

# 2 first week experience:

Milestones:
- 30 different tasks or more (3 tasks for each working day)
  - 1 task from an item
- 1 note created
- Modify the morning routine
- Modify the end of day routine
- 1 or more task tags set up
- 1 or more essential plugin installed
  - Repeating tasks
- 1 or more fun plugins installed
  - Google Photos
  - a theme plugin
  - Stats plugin

Strategy:
- Not forcing the user to do anything more than the necessary to get started -- they just want to work and be productive

Flow of the 2 weeks:
- Day 1: Onboarding
  1. Set up password
  2. Set up timezone
  3. Connect a external account (e.g. Linear, Slack, Google Calendar)
  4. Depending on the time of the day:
     1. Do morning routine (if before 4pm)
        1. Recap of yesterday (skipped)
        2. Intro title (e.g. **Monday**)
        3. Plan for today
        4. When do you plan to stop working?
     2. Do end of day routine (if after 4pm)
        1. Intro title (e.g. **Monday**)
        2. What did you do today?
        3. What will you do tomorrow?
- Day 2:
  - Do morning routine
  - Do end of day routine
  - Suggest a new Plugin?
