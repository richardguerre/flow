/**
 * ðŸš¨ This script should only be run in development and not in production!
 *
 * This script was created to reset other schemas in the database (like pgboss used by the pg-boss library)
 * so that when re-applying migrations, the schema is not already created and the migration fails.
 *
 * The alternatives tried were:
 * - Adding previewFeatures = ["multiSchema"] to the schema in schema.prisma + adding schemas = ["public", "pgboss"]
 *   - This wasn't desirable as it meant making a lot of changes to the schema.prisma file and also adding @@schema to every and new models
 * - Letting it be and communicating to devs that they can either ignore the migration error or manually delete the schema and then re-run the migration
 *   - This wasn't desirable as it meant that every dev would have to do this manually and it would be a pain to do so
 *
 * Notes for executing this script:
 * - Using the prisma client instead of another postgres client because it's already configured and
 * wouldn't require installing another dependency.
