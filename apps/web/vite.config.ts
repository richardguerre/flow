 * This is a custom implementation of babel-plugin-relay and NextJS's swc relay compiler.
 * It was chosen over using the recommended vite-babel-plugin + babel-plugin-relay (or babel-plugin-macros) as using babel meant parsing
 * and transforming the whole codebase twice (once by Vite, and once by Babel), which is not the case with this implementation.
 * The @vitejs/plugin-react-swc@3.1.0-beta.2 plugin was also considered, but it does not seem to work with @swc/plugin-relay.
